				<p>Please note schedule can change at anytime. As the pools are located in a community park there will often be functions or parties for the neighborhood. Flyers will be sent out to the community and more information about closures will be posted on our Facebook page.</p>

				<p>Need a place for your next party!? We welcome any member to plan their next gathering at our facilities. We can accommodate both larger and small groups with a maximum occupancy of 30 people indoors and much more outdoors. In the summer we open up our entire facility and have hosted up to 150 people. Check out some images below for past events! We even offer event planning services if you are looking for some extra help to make your day even more special. </p>

			<p>We also welcome all charities interested in hosting fundraisers. We offer special rates and services where applicable. We are strong believers in community spirit and wish to do our part to help all those in need out. Please consider us for your venue, as we will not disappoint. </p>

			<p>If you have any questions about pricing, in general or would like to plan and event here simply email or call us. We are available Monday-Friday from 8:00am-7:00pm and will respond to emails within 1 business day. </p>
